    :return: The function `strings(x)` returns a list of strings from the input list `x` that have the
    same set of characters as at least one other string in the list. The function iterates through the
    input list and compares each pair of strings to check if they have the same set of characters. If a
    match is found, the strings are added to the output list `b`. The function then
